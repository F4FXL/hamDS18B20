A command line sensor logger for DS18B20 temperature devices, mainly found on Raspberry Pi. It turns the output data into APRS telemetry frames ready to be sent over APRS.
To be used with APRX new exec beacon format or with G4KLX texttransmit to transmit on a DStar repeater.


Install intructions (Debian / Ubuntu)
=====================================

1. Enable 1Wire bus

    google is your friend for wiring the DS18B20 to your pi

2. Install prerequisites

    sudo apt-get install build-essential socat

3. Compile:

    make

4. Install:

    sudo make install

5. Uninstall

    sudo make uninstall
    
6. Adjust settings
    sudo nano /etc/hamds18b20.conf


Usage instructions to send temperature over APRS-IS
============================================================

- Reporting to APRS telemetry is done via some helper script (hamds18b20_status etc ...). Those scripts can be invoked periodically using cron for example.
- Prior first use with APRX edit the config file and put your own callsign on the first line and the path to your ds18b20 on the second line. Put your aprs passcode on the third. adjust aprs server if needed on the fourth line
- Here a crontab example. Telemetrw labels and units are sent every 15 minutes whereas telemetrw values and a status are sent every 5 minutes
